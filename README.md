# Venue Recommendation

#### In this repository, we provide the implementations of three venue recommendation algorithms - DeepVenue (proposed by us), SERGE [1] and DeepCoNN [2]. The implementation of each code is provided (along with ReadMe) in each subfolder.

#### In the "data" folder we share a small simulated toy dataset containg information regarding Meetup entities, using which the codes can be tested. We also provide the description of the files present there in the corresponding ReadMe file. However, the provided dataset is not an authentic sample of any real dataset.

#### For any query, please contact me at soumajit.pramanik@gmail.com
