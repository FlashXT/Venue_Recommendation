# Venue Recommendation

#### In this repository, we provide the implementations of three venue recommendation algorithms - DeepVenue (proposed by us), SERGE [1] and DeepCoNN [2]. The implementation of each code is provided (along with ReadMe) in a sub-folder named the same.

#### In the "data" folder available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E-SqckEtXtiOeuSm4a9tgW9mfQr47cw-?usp=sharing, we share a simulated toy Meetup dataset, using which the aforementioned codes can be tested. Please download and keep the folder in the same directory containing the code folder. We also provide the descriptions of the files present there in a ReadMe file present in the same folder. However, the we do not claim the provided dataset to be an authentic sample of any real dataset.

#### For any query, please contact me at soumajit.pramanik@gmail.com
